# Problem
As students, it is important that we can plan out the courses that we will be taking over our undergraduate career and so we need a system or document that makes that process easy for us. The current system for computer science majors is a set of program sheets, one for each track in the computer science major. While these program sheets are functional, they have a few issues: they are not interactive, they are unclear about or donʼt list all courses for each requirement, and they only list the course numbers for the majority of classes. Our goal is to make the BSCS program sheets as interactive, informative, and accessible as possible while also making the user interface clean and dynamic. The features we are introducing in our new BSCS program sheets are that they will be interactive, they will list all courses for each requirement, they will list all course names and numbers, and the web page will update to reflect your course selections and unit counts as you fill out the sheet.

# User Interface
Our user interface balances ease of use, flexibility, and extensibility. Through the employment of color as a visual aid, users are guided through the worksheetʼs various steps towards the completion of their track requirements. Incomplete requirements are made salient by the color red and return to black once they have been met. At a glance, users can immediately gauge their progress and identify areas that require completion.
The flexibility of the interface allows users freedom in how they provide information and engage with our interactive worksheet. With all fields displayed and available to the user at all times, there is transparency in the length of the worksheet, how the results will be presented, and the overall unit progress towards graduation requirements. Progress updates automatically as users input and change data, giving immediate feedback.
Excitingly, this interface design is easily extensible to other applications. The minimal visual design, tailored to the brand language of Stanford University, means the worksheet design is relevant to other subjects and/or departments at Stanford. Our general, reusable predicates and rules in the underlying logic make it simple for administrators to customize the worksheet to match their specific degree requirements.
