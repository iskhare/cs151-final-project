# Problem
As students, it is important that we can plan out the courses that we will be taking over our undergraduate career and so we need a system or document that makes that process easy for us. The current system for computer science majors is a set of program sheets, one for each track in the computer science major. While these program sheets are functional, they have a few issues: they are not interactive, they are unclear about or don ºt list all courses for each requirement, and they only list the course numbers for the majority of classes. Our goal is to make the BSCS program sheets as interactive, informative, and accessible as possible while also making the user interface clean and dynamic. The features we are introducing in our new BSCS program sheets are that they will be interactive, they will list all courses for each requirement, they will list all course names and numbers, and the web page will update to reflect your course selections and unit counts as you fill out the sheet.
